# Tender
For all of your dating needs

**Disclaimer** This is a project for fun only, no monetization allowed (Not now at least)

### Tech stack

This frontend part of the project uses the React.js with Typescript. Other than that, we have:
- Redux Thunk (For state management)
- Material UI (For the Google's fancy UI components)
- React spring (For making bouncy animations)
- Next.js (I'll think about it)
